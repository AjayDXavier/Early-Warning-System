Early Warning System for Climate-Induced Diseases 🌍🩺
Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning–powered Early Warning System to predict the risk of climate-induced diseases (such as Dengue, Malaria, and Respiratory Illnesses) using climate data, air quality indicators, and epidemiological records.

The system leverages a data processing pipeline with robust preprocessing, class imbalance handling (SMOTE), and machine learning models to provide accurate predictions.

Features 🚀

📊 Data Pipeline: Handles collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering for climate, air quality, and epidemiology data.

⚖️ Imbalance Handling: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance minority disease outbreak classes.

🤖 Models Used:

Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest Regressor (for severity prediction)

Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization

🖥️ User Interface: Prototype real-time system for monitoring outbreak risk.

Tech Stack & Libraries 🛠️

Python (core language)

Data Processing: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, xgboost

Imbalance Handling: imblearn (SMOTE)

Pipeline Building: scikit-learn Pipelines for preprocessing and model training

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts

Methodology 🔬

Data Collection: Integrated datasets covering climate (temperature, humidity, rainfall), air quality (PM2.5, PM10, CO, O₃, NO₂), and epidemiological records.

Preprocessing:

Reindexed time series to continuous daily values

Handled missing values and outliers

Normalized/standardized features

Feature Engineering: Created lag features, moving averages, and climate-health interaction variables.

Model Training:

Trained baseline models using Random Forests

Applied SMOTE to resolve imbalance issues

Tuned hyperparameters via GridSearchCV

Evaluation: Assessed using accuracy, F1-score, precision-recall metrics for classification and RMSE for regression.

Results 📈

Improved classification performance by handling imbalance with SMOTE.

Random Forest models provided robust performance across both classification and regression tasks.

Demonstrated potential for real-time disease outbreak risk monitoring using AI + IoT pipelines.

👉 Future scope: Integration with IoT devices for real-time environmental data collection and deployment as a web-based dashboard for public health officials.
